# Computer Graphics Projects

This repository contains various computer graphics projects and applications developed as part of a Computer Graphics course. Each project explores different concepts and techniques in computer graphics programming.

## Project List

### Project 1: ImageFilterApp

A Qt-based desktop application for applying various image filters without relying on external image processing libraries. The application implements custom filters that operate directly on image pixels.

**Key features:**
- Simple and intuitive user interface
- Basic image loading and saving functionality
- Multiple pixel-level filters including inversion, brightness, contrast, and gamma correction
- No external image processing libraries used - all filters implemented from scratch
